*** BUG ***
-- NPHI>MMAX*2 is right condition for the sampling theorem to apply.	(16/10/2008)
-- Bug found in SHT.c : here are the correct versions of LiM() and LM marcros :	(16/10/2008)
	#define LiM(l,im) ( (im*(2*LMAX+2 -MRES*(im+1)))/2 + l )
	#define LM(l,m) ( (m*(2*LMAX+2 -(m+MRES)))/(2*MRES) + l )

*** Optimizations ***
- SHT : use DCT space, keep low NLAT but regular grid and Gauss quadrature (??)
        synthesis should be faster, analysis same speed.

- SHT : implement even and odd sub-cases.

- grid : try full NR*NLM matrices, loops are more efficient but what about cache ???

- wouldn't it be better to store Tlm and Plm with m contiguous for each l ???

+(- use "alloca()" to allocate temp memory on the stack with variable lengths) // ultrafast but not ANSI

=> time different implementations and chose the fastest...

*** Features ***
+ velocity field computation
+ inner core differential rotation
- conducting outer shell
- insulating inner core

+ boundary conditions dependence

*** SHT.c
+ even/odd l dependance...
+ MMAX = 0 case possible
