*** BUG ***
++ It seems that if NPHI=MMAX*2, vector SHTs are not working correctly. if NPHI>MMAX*2 it is...

*** Optimizations ***
- SHT : use DCT space, keep low NLAT but regular grid and Gauss quadrature (??)
        synthesis should be faster, analysis same speed.

- SHT : implement even and odd sub-cases.

- grid : try full NR*NLM matrices, loops are more efficient but what about cache ???

- wouldn't it be better to store Tlm and Plm with m contiguous for each l ???

+(- use "alloca()" to allocate temp memory on the stack with variable lengths) // ultrafast but not ANSI

=> time different implementations and chose the fastest...

*** Features ***
+ velocity field computation
- inner core differential rotation
- conducting outer shell
- insulating inner core

+ boundary conditions dependence

-SHT.c
+ even/odd l dependance...
+ MMAX = 0 case possible
