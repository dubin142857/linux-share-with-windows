*** Optimizations ***
- SHT : use DCT space, keep low NLAT but regular grid and Gauss quadrature (??)
        synthesis should be faster, analysis same speed.
- SHT : implement even and odd sub-cases.
- grid : try full NR*NLM matrices, loops are more efficient but what about cache ???

=> time different implementations and chose the fastest...

*** Features ***
+ velocity field computation
- inner core differential rotation
- conducting outer shell
- insulating inner core

+ boundary conditions dependence
+ even/odd l dependance...
